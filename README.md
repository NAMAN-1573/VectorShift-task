# Project Setup and Running Instructions

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 🟢 (for frontend)
- **Python** 🐍 (for backend)
- **Git** 🐱 (for cloning the repository)
- **Git Bash** or **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** 💻 (for running the shell script on Windows)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository 📂

First, clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone "(https://github.com/NAMAN-1573/VectorShift-task.git)"
```

### 2. Install Frontend Dependencies 📦

Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install the required Node.js packages:

```bash
cd vectorshift/frontend
npm install
```

### 3. Install Backend Dependencies 📦

Navigate to the `backend` directory and install the required Python packages:

```bash
cd vectorshift/backend
pip install fastapi uvicorn networkx pydantic
```







  ```bash
  cd path/to/root
  ```


#### For Windows 🖥️

Use Git Bash or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to run the shell script.

- Open Git Bash and navigate to the root directory:

  ```bash
  cd /vectorshift
  ```





### 5. Verify Servers Are Running ✅

Check the terminal output to ensure both frontend and backend servers are running correctly. You should see logs indicating that both servers have started successfully.

## Troubleshooting 🛠️

- **Script Permissions**: If you encounter permission issues on macOS or Linux, use `chmod +x start-all.sh` to make the script executable.
- **Dependency Issues**: Ensure all dependencies are correctly listed in `package.json` (for frontend). Reinstall packages if necessary.
- **Running on Windows**: If Git Bash or WSL is not available, you can run the frontend and backend servers separately using their respective commands in different terminal windows.
